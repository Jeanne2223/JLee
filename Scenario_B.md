# Scenario B

Hi Pia,

We really appreciate your commitment and interest in the course.

Normally, second chances are given to students to continue with the course under *extenuating circumstances such as death in the family or accidents.*

As much as we would like to give you a chance to continue with the course, we are also concerned that this may overwhelm you taking into account your current school commitment and work. However, you may continue watching the sessions at your own pace to continue learning. 

Moving forward, we suggest for you to retake the course in the next semester when you have more time and better availability so you can focus and learn as much from the course.

You may email us at admissions@codepath.org for next semester's schedule of classes.

We look forward to having you in the next semester. 


All the best,  
CodePath.org Team
