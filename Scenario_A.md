# Scenario A

Hi Raju,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

As mentioned in the email notification you have received, you were marked *Absent* for the class last Wednesday, May 19, 2021. Based on our record, you attended class for only *10 minutes* which did not meet the criteria to be counted as *Present*. 

As per course policy, there are 3 instances for a student to be marked *Absent*.
- Requested Absence filed at least 3 months before the scheduled absence.
- Attended the session but stayed for less than half the duration of the session.
- Did not attend the session at all.


For your reference on the attendance and other course policies, check this **[Course Policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19)** link.

Hope this clarifies your concern.

Regards,

CodePath.org Team
